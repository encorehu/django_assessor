However, the interview should begin with a gentler approach to engage the client, then building to the more powerful stance. That's why answer B is better than answer A. C is incorrect because people in crisis need structure. Allowing too much ventilation and self- exploration can lead to an increased sense of confusion and crisis. D is incorrect because psychosocial approaches should be attempted before turning to anti-anxiety medications unless the anxiety is posing an immediate threat to the client's health or ability to engage in problem solving.

That's why B is incorrect. Instead of discharging pent up tension, continued pacing might lead to an escalation of the client's tension. Of course, if you attempt to have the client sit but he strongly refuses, the best thing to do is to stand yourself. If you were to remain sitting that would suggest an unequal power balance which can lead to an escalation. C is incorrect because it may not be necessary. The approach described in A should be tried first. D is incorrect because it would be inappropriate to call the police unless the client was presenting an imminent physical threat. Such a threat is not evident from the question.",

A is incorrect because an employer can establish policies which require you to document or report various aspects of your work, even when your actions are mandated by law. The employer is prohibited from interfering with your compliance with the law, but there is no indication that the supervisor in this question is interfering. B is incorrect because there is no prohibition against informing your supervisor about the content of the report. Your clinical record will have to document the report anyway, and a supervisor normally has access to clinical records of clients on a supervisee\u2019s caseload. D is incorrect for the same reason.

C is incorrect A because a simple, closed ended question about abuse is not likely to yield very meaningful information. D is correct because it will help to engage Mrs. James and give her a sense of being listened to and, in the process of hearing her description of \"the complex problem\" you will probably be able to gather important information, possibly even picking up on indicators of abuse if that's occurring.",

A is incorrect. Some therapists and some programs might choose to take this approach, but it is not necessary. B is incorrect because other professional staff are bound by the same confidentiality requirements that apply to you, and if there are nonprofessional staff in the program they should be bound by confidentiality policies and procedures of the program. D is incorrect because the client should not be expected to repeat her story over and over again with each staff member.

C is incorrect because this approach is very intrusive and would violate the client\u2019s confidentiality as well as his right to self-determination.

A is incorrect because, although respect for one another is a desirable norm, it should not be used \"instead of\" conflict and disagreement. People need to engage in conflict and disagreement respectfully. B is incorrect because the group needs to develop its own indigenous leadership. That's the purpose of the exploring and testing phase of group development.

You have permission to release the information even without the client\u2019s consent.

A less intense, less restrictive approach should first be tried while living at home. B is incorrect because, even though neuroleptic medication is sometimes used to treat the aggressive, negative and hostile behavior of a conduct disorder, it is not the preferred treatment approach. Also, note that a marriage and family therapist should not refer a client for a specific kind of medication. An MFT should refer for a medication evaluation, with the physician determining the kind of medication that will be used to treat the symptom.

B is incorrect because you would need to make the report (as indicated in answer D) regardless of the outcome of your appeal to the higher authority. That appeal may help you deal with the conflict between you and your supervisor, but it does not influence your need to make the report. C is incorrect because a report became necessary when you formed your reasonable suspicion, regardless of anything you might learn from the client's father.

An employee does not have the authority to redefine an organization's mission. That is the responsibility of its board of directors. Acceptance of the organization's mission is considered to be an aspect of the employment contract.

A supervisor does not have the authority to change an agency\u2019s mission, nor to misrepresent an employee\u2019s work. D is incorrect for the same reason that A is incorrect. An employee does not have the authority to redefine an organization's mission, even if the employee\u2019s clients agree.

Even though that is possible, excessive caffeine use is a more likely cause and, therefore, the better answer. C is incorrect because, although cultural orientation may influence the way in which symptoms are manifest, caffeine intoxication is more likely than culture to be a direct cause of the symptoms described in the question.

In fact, the insight your client gains through these spells may even be a source of support and adaptation. Her belief about communicating with spirits of deceased relatives may not be considered delusional if it is a culturally held belief, shared with others. You should still monitor for the development of a true psychotic disorder, as with any client under extreme stress, because even people who experience\u2018 culturally normative spells can develop psychotic disorders. For example, the content of your client's experiences may change to beliefs that are not normative for her culture, and her functioning might become significantly impaired as a result. However, there is no indication of that at this time. A is incorrect because culturally held beliefs are not delusions. B is incorrect because your client's level of distress is not seen as exceptional for a person of her age and culture, nor is her functioning significantly impaired by the stress of her move.
