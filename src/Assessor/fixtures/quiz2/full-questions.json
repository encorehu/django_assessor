A would not be an appropriate response if these conditions applied. However, B would be an appropriate response under a wide variety of conditions. C is incorrect because you don't have enough information to know that medications might be needed. Not all clients who feel confused and anxious when under stress need to be referred for medications. D is incorrect because this kind of exploratory, interpretive therapy is not the best approach when clients are in crisis.

B is incorrect because, although some therapists may need therapy in order to become sufficiently empathic, it is possible to be very empathic without any therapy at all.

B is   incorrect because oedipal conflicts usually involve issues of guilt, anxiety and personal ideals. This couple appears to be on opposite ends of a wide variety of issues.

C is incorrect because Mr. P might be hostile toward the therapist, but this would only be one of many possible reasons for the resistance. There is no specific evidence from the question that Mr. P is angry toward the therapist. His resistance might just as well be due to shame, anxiety or fear. A is a better answer.

C is incorrect because any peace officer may involuntarily hold an individual under this law if the peace officer believes the person to be a danger due to a mental disorder.

In disengagement there is very little resonance to one another, even when important issues are raised by a family member. A is incorrect because family systems are not designed.

C is incorrect because the question is based on an Eriksonian conceptual framework. Erikson does not focus on such Freudian psychosexual issues as the Oedipal conflict.
