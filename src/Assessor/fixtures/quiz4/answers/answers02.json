A is incorrect because recalling of pleasant memories does not cause hallucinations of any kind.

Hallucinations, especially olfactory hallucinations, are organically caused. D is incorrect because schizophrenia characteristically causes auditory hallucinations, and sometimes visual hallucinations, but it is not likely to cause olfactory hallucinations. 1.* The correct answer is B. A child\u2019s environment plays a key role in the treatment of oppositional defiant disorder. Teachers, counselors, clergy, probation officers and others in authority relationships with the child may need help learning to reinforce the techniques used by the therapist to support the child\u2019s problem solving, anger management, social skills, and communication skills by modeling and rewarding appropriate behavior in their respective community environments. A is incorrect because confrontation regarding the parents\u2019 role in the problem is more relevant to the purpose and processes of the therapeutic relationship than to the parent-teacher relationship. C is incorrect because no inherent role conflict is involved when a therapist and teacher collaborate if the two parties are clear about their respective roles and the client focused purpose of their collaboration. D is incorrect because of the importance of the teacher and others in reinforcing the techniques used by the therapist.",

Part of its successful dissemination results from the well documented efficacy of the model, however many who claim to use the ACT model borrow some features but not others. A high fidelity, robust replication of the model means that you are using most, if not all, of its features, including the fact that Marx, Test and Stein used relatively small client to staff ratios in order to achieve their efficacious results. A is incorrect because the ACT model encourages seriously mentally ill clients to become active in the community and to join organizations. The model does not assume that people with serious mental illness find involvement in work and social recreation to be too stressful. The important thing is to encourage a degree of community involvement that the individual is ready for. C is incorrect because the ACT model uses a multidisciplinary team, but emphasizes the interchangeability of roles, not well differentiated roles. D is incorrect because the ACT model is designed to provide relatively long term services over the years.",

A is incorrect because this approach provides little support. Instead of working toward abstinence or anticipating triggers to reuse, this approach leaves the client vulnerable to cravings as they arise. B is incorrect because the cognitive process of reviewing the negative and delayed consequences of one's substance use may be useful during an early engagement process, or later during the maintenance phase of change, but the focus during early abstinence should be on the abstaining behaviors. C is incorrect because long term goals are too abstract and general to provide a structured focus for changing immediate behaviors.

A is incorrect because antisocial personality traits involve exploitive and hurtful relationships with other people. It is more about behavior than it is about experience of reality.

A is incorrect because arbitrary inference involves coming to the conclusion that you want to come to in the absence of supporting information or in spite of contradictory evidence. For example, if you believe you will never pass an exam that a great majority of people pass by the second attempt, you ignore the evidence of the high passing rate and tell yourself that the passing rate is low.

        "text": "Triangulation is a dysfunctional strategy used by members of a family to avoid dealing with conflict in a subsystem such as the marital relationship. This strategy involves diverting the energy of the conflict to a third member of the family. There are two types of triangulation. The first, exemplified by the vignette, is termed \u201cdetour protect.\u201d This type involves two family members joining together to protect another family member. Typically, the intensity of the effort to protect appears excessive or outright unnecessary. The other type of triangulation termed \u201cdetour attack,\u201d involves two family members joining together against another family member who is seen as a common enemy. These coalitions can be formed between the mother and father or across generational boundaries. A and C are incorrect because distraction and displacement are ego defense mechanisms, aspects of personality, which may contribute to triangulation in family dynamics, but are not a matter of family dynamics per se. D is incorrect because negotiation is a healthy means of resolving conflict, not avoiding it as happens with triangulation. 172*. The correct answer is D, initiation of the differentiation process coupled with rejection of her individuation by her caretakers. Clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder present as extremely unstable, particularly with respect to interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect. Borderline clients will often demonstrate an inability to understand that when they leave a person, that person will continue to exist. As a result, they become overwhelmed by their fear of abandonment and will tend to cling to people in moments of separation while, in contrast, they may push people away as they get too close. Kernberg and Hughes recognized the resemblance between this behavior and the behavior of a three year old child who is faced with the developmental challenge referred to by Margaret Mahler as \u201cseparation- individuation.\u201d While a child is undergoing separation-individuation, it is important that the primary caretakers support the child\u2019s efforts to separate and individuate while making it clear to the child that they are a secure base. If the caretakers do not provide a secure base for the child, separation may trigger overwhelming anxiety for the child. Like the borderline client, these children demonstrate insecurity regarding interpersonal relationships.
