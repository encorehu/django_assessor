            "explanation": "Both A and B are true answers. A is the best answer because genuineness directly builds trust. This is almost obvious if you consider the opposite statement, \"Deceit (or duplicity) builds trust,\" which is obviously untrue. B is a true statement in the sense that genuineness leads to trust which leads to self-revelation which leads to the potential for a deeper understanding of the client's psychodynamics, but B is not as directly true as A is. There is no empirical basis for assuming that C is true, and some empirical evidence that it is not true. D is incorrect because accurate empathy refers to the ability to use one's own imagination and experience to understand another's experience. This is not directly related to genuineness. It is possible to be genuine but lack empathy."

A is incorrect because a 10 year old child cannot consent to their own treatment. Consent must be provided by a parent or guardian.

            "explanation": "Any marriage and family text will attest to A. B is established in psychoanalytic theory. Many people will rule out C simply because support and reassurance seem to be positive techniques, but even a positive technique can have a downside. Support and reassurance can relieve some of the anxiety that might be motivating a client to work on problems and change. This can lead to a \"flight into health\" and the client can come to depend on the therapist\u2019s support and reassurance, . rather than developing their own internal locus of control and judgment about their own adequacy. All three options are correct, so D is the best answer."

C is incorrect because ventilation will not necessarily deepen the therapeutic alliance. For example, some clients come to feel ashamed and, therefore, more guarded with their therapist after having revealed more than they, in retrospect, feel that they should have.

A person's degree of acculturation must be determined by the individual himself or herself. Many individuals prefer to live primarily within a cultural community with little contact with the multicultural mainstream community. The client in the question might even be expecting to return to his or her native country, in which case acculturation in this country would be less relevant. B is incorrect because it makes the assumptions made by answer A, and because it assumes that family members are the best source of cultural socialization. This is not always the case. Answer D is incorrect because, like answer A, it does not allow for self- determination. Answer C is based on the value of self-determination."

            "explanation": "Considering the client's purpose in seeking therapy, the treatment is likely to be relatively lengthy. The therapist has time to allow the client's story to unfold as a way of engaging and assessing. B is incorrect because in the initial interview the therapist doesn't know enough about the client to recommend any particular solution. C is incorrect because the presenting problem hasn't yet been fully expressed. You can't focus on the development of something unless you know what that something is. There are clients, therapists and therapeutic approaches for which D might be a correct answer, but A is a much better reflection of the general standard of practice with a client who presents with this therapeutic goal.

Besides, triangulation could be tested when a single therapist works with a couple. C is a popular answer to this question. Co-therapists might attempt to model cross gender communication at times. However, A is considered a better answer because it relates to the entire course of therapy and because co-therapists of both sexes will accomplish the purpose expressed in A even in cases where there is no attempt to model cross gender communication. Note that this question might not make much sense if it applied to a client couple in which both partners were of the same sex, but most couples are two gender couples and questions should be answered in relation to the most commonly arising conditions.

If Mrs. K's level of distress were disabling, then reducing the anxiety might actually help to increase motivation. But since it wasn't disabling, it is more likely that her level of anxiety was motivating her to change. B is incorrect because overventilation is much more likely to result from high anxiety than from having one's anxiety reduced. Support and reassurance might lead to a variety of changes that might ultimately lead to expanded emotional awareness, but this is not a direct effect. Reduced motivation for change can be a direct effect. Support and reassurance play such a small role in the overall therapeutic strategy for restructuring character that D is not a good answer."

C is incorrect because the law doesn\u2019t recognize a family as being a client. This is a clinical concept.

B is incorrect because the capacity for logical thought doesn't develop until well after the capacity for denial (e. g. simply closing one's eyes as a way of denying reality, as often happens in infancy or toddlerhood). C is false because sublimation is considered to be the most highly developed and adaptive defense mechanism and we need a sense of interpersonal boundaries to experience identification. Introj ection occurs unconsciously and ignores interpersonal boundaries. D is incorrect because impulse control and sense of reality are ego functions, not ego defense mechanisms."

The client's response to a request to make a calculation may be influenced by the client's culture, but the actual calculation should be similar across cultures. It is true that educational attainment across cultures varies, and education can affect calculation ability, but this is not a cultural factor per se. B is incorrect because most cultures use the same calendar for purposes of daily commerce and cross cultural communication, even though some cultures use unique calendars for marking religious or spiritual time. C is incorrect because this is a nonverbal task which is less likely than others to be influenced by culture. D is correct because proverbs and their interpretations vary substantially across cultures. It is possible that a client of another culture may not have even heard the proverb presented by a clinician prior to the time of the interview, whereas clients of the same culture may be very familiar with the proverb and its common interpretations."

C is incorrect because the referring party does not usually become the therapist\u2019s client. For example, a referring primary care physician does not become the therapist\u2019s client, and the therapist has no treatment responsibility to the physician as an individual.

In arguing for answer B, one could say that everyone has some significant unresolved conflicts. That may be true, but even if it is true there is no reason to think that the client's devaluations at the time of termination are an indication of those unresolved conflicts. In most cases, the most likely reason for the devaluing is described in answer A.

Most marriage and family therapists have better things to do with their time.

The code also prohibits providing services that create a conflict of interest that may impair work performance or clinical judgment. The kind of barter arrangement described in this question could distort the professional relationship and constitute a conflict of interest. This is an especially problematic type of barter relationship, or dual relationship, in which services are offered in payment. A is incorrect because your decision to exclude the uncle from sessions may be influenced by your desire to receive his services.

            "explanation": "A is not a good answer because your client may not be able to determine when her daughter is clean and sober and when she is not. But she will be able to determine whether or not her daughter has paid the rent and engaged in acceptable behavior (as is called for in C). B encourages the client to take responsibility for the way her 26 year old daughter lives her life, thereby reinforcing the existing problem of codependency. D is not a good answer because your client needs to learn to manage her life and the consequences of her daughter's behavior as it affects her life. C will do that directly. D might not do that at all. Besides, there is probably no way your client will ever know how much of her daughter\u2019s dysfunctional behavior is due to her parenting behavior, to other childhood caretakers, to genetic predisposition, to society's norms and values, to chance encounters with drugs, or to her daughter\u2019s personal choice and exercise of free will."

D is a poor answer because her feeling of being ready to terminate could arise as a resistance to change or she might enjoy the therapeutic relationship and never feel ready to terminate.

            "explanation": "All aspects of treatment should be therapeutic. This question only asks about when therapeutic change can begin to happen. It is not asking when therapeutic change is most likely, or most significant. Although individualized intervention strategies are usually implemented following the development of a treatment plan, techniques involved in the development of a therapeutic relationship and the provision of support are a form of generalized treatment applicable to almost all clients during the engagement phase."

The literature on crisis intervention and brief therapy usually notes the importance of specifying a limited time frame (A) in order to mobilize energy for therapeutic change. B through D can also be used to mobilize change, or not, but they are more peripherally related to the issue. C, use of role play, neither mobilizes nor inhibits a client's motivation for change. A is directly related to the issue of mobilizing energy for change."

The rich array of thoughts, experiences and feelings that might be expressed through ventilation will require some degree of clarification before the client\u2019s revelations can be interpreted.

            "explanation": "See AAMFT Code of Ethics which states that \u201cMarriage and family therapists assist persons in obtaining other therapeutic services if the therapist is unable or unwilling, for appropriate reasons, to provide professional help.\u201d This standard alludes to the fact that terminations must be for appropriate reasons. Another standard states that \u201cMarriage and family therapists do not use their professional relationships with clients to further their own interests.\u201d Therefore, marriage and family therapists should not terminate services to pursue a social, financial, or sexual relationship with a client. Therefore, A is incorrect because the termination is being done to further one\u2019s own interests. Even though the client will have continued therapy available, it could be detrimental to the client to interrupt a successful course of therapy and begin again unnecessarily. C is incorrect because you may not enter into this business relationship whether or not you believe the client's request represents a resistence. D is incorrect because of the ethical standards stated above, and because it implies a dual relationship. Because you have a personal financial incentive to terminate you are not in a position to be an impartial judge regarding whether or not such a move would further the client\u2019s therapy goals."

By making members aware of the group's importance and relevance to their needs the therapist can help members make this important decision. B is incorrect because members of this kind of group need to communicate directly with one another, not through the therapist.

This is more of a Behavioral Therapy concept which would probably not be well suited to the issue of peak experience. Peak experiences need to be allowed to happen, not made to happen. B is incorrect because, even though clients of Humanistic Existential Therapies may keep journals, they do not keep logs. A journal is written in narrative form and is an aid in developing insight. A log is written in more of a list form with ratings and is an aid in developing valid and reliable descriptions of behavior and cognitions.

D is incorrect because perceptual dominance refers to the pre-operational period quality of allowing immediate sensory experience to override logic if the two are in conflict- Such a quality may be related to egocentrism, but the concept of egocentrism much more closely captures the features described in the question. Keep in mind that the cognitive quality of egocentrism should not be confused with the personality trait of egocentrism. Both involve the inability to take another person\u2019s perspective and engage in empathic understanding, but the personality trait is the result of emotional and experiential as well as cognitive processes."

C is incorrect because reality testing is an ego function, therefore it is relevant to assessing ego functioning. D is incorrect because culture shapes the way in which we express our ego functions. For example, when assessing the ego function of object relations we need to remember that some cultures support independence and others support mutual dependence. When assessing the ego function of judgment we need to remember that some cultures support risk taking, others support minimizing risks. In general, you would expect to find strong similarities between two forty year old men and women of a particular culture. You would expect to find strong dissimilarities between a five year old and forty year old.

The MFT must be specially designated, for example by virtue of being on the staff of a mobile crisis team. C is incorrect because any peace officer may involuntarily hold an individual under this law if the peace officer believes the person to be a danger due to a mental disorder. The assumption regarding the mental disorder does not need to be confirmed by a mental health professional. D is incorrect because only certain designated mental health professionals may hold a person involuntarily, regardless of the opinion of a peace officer. "

Termination is a loss and, if sufficient time is allotted to work it through, clients can learn skills in coping with loss during the termination process (A). Also, client regression often occurs at termination as a way of trying to reverse the decision and maintain the relationship (B).

B is incorrect because the developmental issue of generativity vs. stagnation follows intimacy vs. isolation. Generativity becomes possible once we have learned to enter into the intimate relationships that make it possible to generate families, projects and careers. C is incorrect because the question is based on an Eriksonian conceptual framework. Erikson does not focus on such Freudian psychosexual issues as the Oedipal conflict.

A client's degree of alertness and wakefulness should be apparent from simple interview questions and would not require a calculation test.

A person may be asked to follow a set of procedures, such as arranging matchsticks in a particular geometric pattern, but this is a test for apraxia or disturbed executive function, not orientation.

A and B are incorrect because the law allows sharing of confidential information among staff of a program and even staff of a service system, as long as the client is informed at the outset of treatment that such sharing of information is the practice.

            "explanation": " Humanistic Existential Therapies recognize that circumstances influence individuals, but that we each make choices about what we will do with our circumstances. A is incorrect because the focus is on the individuals will and free choice, not on social determinants of one's behavior. The social environment is recognized and understood, but is not the focus of the therapy. B is incorrect because lack of opportunity is one aspect of the social environment.

Also, the use of imagination in this technique is not viewed as inherently healing, but as a means to the end of self-exploration and self-integration. B is incorrect because the holy trinity is a Christian concept which is not accepted by all Humanistic Existential therapists.

If the depression is, in fact, due to the substance use it may not fully clear until the substance abuse treatment is successful. However, gains in depressive symptom reduction might still be achieved during a concurrent treatment approach. B and D are incorrect because, if treatment of the depression were withheld until abstinence was achieved, then it may not be possible to address depressive symptoms such as low self-esteem and social withdrawal that might increase suicide risk. C is incorrect because, if you are correct in your impression that the depression is due to the substance use, you will not be able to successfully resolve the depression while the client is still abusing substances."

            "explanation": "Both assessment and self-demonstrations are core purposes for play therapy. Play therapy is commonly used for assessment. It provides a child with an opportunity to act out behavioral patterns, motivations and conflictual themes which are then observable by the therapist. In the course of acting out one's inner life these patterns, motivations and themes also become observable to the clients themselves. Therefore, play therapy -- along with role plays, psychodrama, free association, and structured fantasy -- are considered to be self-demonstrations. A is incorrect because only medications can treat problems of serotonin uptake, which occurs between nerve synapses. B is incorrect because cognitive restructuring is a more Verbal and rational process used in cognitive behavioral therapy.

Termination under these circumstances should not be precipitous, and should always involve assistance to the client in making appropriate follow-up arrangements for continued services elsewhere when necessary.\\n A is incorrect because ethical standards do allow for such termination.

In a manic person such behavior would be a manifestation of the manic episode, namely, the tendency to engage in pleasurable activities that have a high probability of negative consequences. B is incorrect because PCP use would exacerbate the schizophrenic's symptoms, not relieve them. Most schizophrenic individuals will avoid PCP because its effect is very frightening.

The young child at this stage is incapable of true empathy, even though the child can imitate another person's apparent behavior, and even though the capacity for empathy is already beginning to emerge. A is incorrect because repeated bed wetting at the age of five would likely meet the DSM criteria for enuresis.

This means that a marriage and family therapist cannot avoid the reporting implications of this law simply by failing to learn about indicators of child abuse or by ignoring these issues when conducting comprehensive clinical assessments.

This theory assumes that whatever we may want, there is also a way in which we don\u2019t want it, and whatever we don\u2019t want, there is also a way in which we do want it.

B is incorrect because behavioral rehearsal is a form of role playing in which a client is presented with verbal instruction and/or a demonstration of the desired behavior, then given opportunities for practice followed by feedback and reward. This approach generally requires a client who is more motivated and interactive than the one described in this question. C is incorrect because extinction is a technique used to reduce the frequency of problematic behaviors that have been sustained by reinforcement. Even if it were possible to eliminate the mutism by using this technique, extinction alone would not replace it with socially useful speech. D is incorrect because covert sensitization associates imagery of aversive conditions with imagery of undesirable behaviors.

In other words, the client needs to believe that she is enough like you to be able to do what you are doing when modeling. If she has not come to identify with you she may observe your use of empathic listening skills, self-assertion and limit setting techniques and think (for example) \u201cI wish I were an older, professionally trained, middle class person like my therapist so that I could do what she is doing.\u201d Also, consider that enhancing a client\u2019s identification with you is an aspect of establishing the therapeutic alliance. C and D are incorrect because, even though they may be important issues in a long term, psychodynamic working through of the problem\u2019s underlying causes, they are not as relevant as modeling of solution focused communication and parenting skills if you are taking a problem oriented approach.

The person is still physiologically dependent on alcohol, and withdrawal symptoms should be expected upon abstinence, but smaller amounts of alcohol will be needed for intoxication. C is incorrect because such liver damage is usually associated with a chronic and regressed state of alcohol dependence, not early recovery. Recovery can begin at any time, however the pattern described in the question is not especially associated with the onset of recovery. D is incorrect because the question describes a common pattern among persons with long standing alcohol dependencies. Such a report from a client should not be presumed to be untruthful."

The individual\u2019s panic does meet the criteria for a panic attack - that is, a discrete period of intense anxiety which peaks within 10 minutes - but it is not the kind of uncued panic attack found in panic disorders. B is incorrect because social phobia involves generalized or pervasive social anxiety, whereas this individual\u2019s anxiety is aroused by a specific social situation, being called upon to speak by the teacher. The individual is not anxious when with family or when with friends on the playground.

Although you may not abandon the clients, you can terminate couples therapy if you help the individuals find alternative services to meet their current needs. A is incorrect because a \u201cno secrets\u201d agreement in couples therapy is a mutual agreement between the partners, as well as an agreement with the therapist. Although a therapist must accept a client\u2019s right to withdraw waivers of confidentiality which are given to a therapist, this principle does not apply to one\u2019s partner. B is incorrect because you do not have an obligation to inform the partner of the affair, even though one could legitimately argue that you have a right to inform the partner of the affair. D is incorrect because such agreements can be revoked. For example, both partners could mutually agree that they want to revoke their agreement to the initial \u201cno secrets\u201d policy.

A is incorrect because autonomic hyperactivity cannot be consciously controlled. This approach will only continue to make things worse. B is incorrect because this approach could give the illusion of being able to consciously manage a panic attack, and because the symptoms will spontaneously extinguish whether or not the individual tries to exaggerate the experience. D is incorrect because the symptoms of a panic attack are so intense that distraction would be extremely difficult.

As a result, many have borrowed aspects of DBT (such as psychoeducational group therapy which focuses on interpersonal skills, distress tolerance/reality acceptance, and skills in regulating emotions) and claim to be using a DBT model, but these fragmented approaches do not maintain fidelity to the model.

B is incorrect because, even though apologies might be a prosocial thing to do when the timing is right, it will not help the child to develop a greater sense of _ empathy.

This client's suicide attempts may have been due to impulse control problems, thrill seeking, or attempts to manipulate others, rather than due to a desire to die. B is incorrect because this client may not be a reliable reporter with regard to this issue. For example, the client might have a dysthymic disorder. The substances might exacerbate his dysthymia.

With that entire you might have an opportunity to briefly describe your services so that the prospective client can make an informed choice about accepting or rejecting your services. B is incorrect because A is a better answer. The A approach introduces you to the prospective client as an auxiliary ally, whereas the B approach introduces you to her in a way that could arouse some jealousy or competition. C is incorrect because the prospective client has not yet had an opportunity to make an informed choice.

            "explanation": "All four of these issues are relevant to psychosocial assessment of a person at any age. However, answer C - an individual's response to social demands to begin making adult role choices - is most directly relevant to adolescent identity formation. A is incorrect because a sense of common personhood is most directly relevant in old age at the developmental stage of integrity. A well developed recognition of this issue would be premature to expect in adolescence. B is incorrect because deriving a sense of self-esteem by caring for others is most directly relevant in mid-life at the developmental stage of generativity. D is incorrect because a sense of time perspective is established during infancy at the stage of basic trust. 25* The correct answer is C. This option describes the most specific, observable change this client might make as a step toward accomplishing her ultimate goal. It is also consistent with the well established principle that exposure to the feared stimulus (under the right conditions) is an effective step toward reducing phobic anxiety. A is incorrect for a couple of reasons. First, it describes your intervention, that is, to help the client obtain medications. The objective of that intervention is to reduce anxiety. Interventions are not objectives. Objectives are the intended result of interventions. Second, there is no indication that a physician has found anti-anxiety medications to be indicated. If anything, you should help the client obtain a medication evaluation. Then, let the doctor decide if the client should obtain medications. B is incorrect because \"improve ego functioning\" is too broadly stated to serve as an objective. It lacks focus and would not provide much sense of direction to a treatment plan. D is incorrect because there is no reason to think that this particular client has social anxiety because of low self-esteem or that self-esteem needs to be improved in order to accomplish this client's goal of reducing social anxiety, thereby improving job performance."

The client is not yet planning to take action. Moving too fast will threaten the therapeutic relationship. This is a phase of tentative exploration of the issues in a general way. A is incorrect because the client is not yet committed to working on the substance abuse issue, and may choose not to. Even when the client becomes more committed to working on this issue, attention should still be given to the client\u2019s variety of psychosocial issues, rather than focusing primarily on his substance use. Unresolved psychosocial problems could trigger regression and relapse even after an active recovery process has begun. C is incorrect because the client is not yet planning to make changes.

For example, a client who plans to commit an arson fire might hope that nobody is in the building. However, the client presents a serious danger of violence to those who are in the building in spite of his wishes. C is incorrect because the Tarasoff decision refers to serious danger of violence and is not limited to murder, even though it was a murder case in which this precedence was established.

Some cognitive functioning is lost with each stroke, then mental status stabilizes until the next small stroke. A is incorrect because amnestic disorder involves memory loss with no other cognitive disturbance. This client is experiencing memory loss plus loss of calculation ability and ability to communicate in writing. B is incorrect because delirium involves disorientation and a clouding of consciousness, often with incoherence. There is no evidence of these symptoms in the question. D is incorrect because dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type involves a more or less steady progressive deterioration in cognitive functioning, not the stepwise deterioration followed by stabilization that is described in this question. 29* The correct answer is D. You should help Mrs. J understand the nature of reactive attachment disorder, including the needs of this child and prognosis for improvement, so that she can make an informed decision. She needs to be allowed to make the decision that is right for her. A is incorrect because the client needs to resolve her own ambivalence and because you can't be sure about the extent to which the child will overcome his symptoms in time.

Such goals might be viewed as meaningless and will not lead to a sense of achievement or self-esteem. An exception to this principle might be made for a client who is feeling severely hopeless and helpless, and who is therefore difficult to engage. C is incorrect because the more positive outlook has come to be generally favored in clinical practice. This is consistent with a strengths based perspective. A positive approach might emphasize learning to \u201cfeel relaxed\u201d rather than \u201creduce anxiety.\u201d This positive focus has long been recognized as the favored orientation in hypnotherapy, as well as in marketing.

D is incorrect because it focuses on one possible explanation for the client\u2019s concerns, but it is an explanation identified by the interviewer, not by the client.

A is incorrect because the stressor does not need to be the ultimate cause of the problem. For example, a socially isolated person with poor coping skills might have a minor auto accident and develop an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The accident did not cause the symptoms, because most people experiencing the same kind of accident would not become as deeply depressed. In this case the social isolation and weak ego functioning could be seen as the cause of the problem, with the auto accident as the trigger that led to the emergence of symptoms.

            "explanation": "Research has found that a therapist can reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD following a trauma by using a crisis intervention approach that focuses on disclosing the traumatic events, exploring troubling reactions, identifying coping strategies, developing a plan of action, and providing referrals for supportive services such as medical care and self-help groups. B is incorrect because people who have been traumatized usually have a need to tell and retell the story of the trauma. This can become a preoccupation or obsession if it is not accompanied by a discussion of the client\u2019s strengths, coping strategies, and a plan of action, but these positive issues should not be used to suppress or distract attention from the trauma.

If your client saw his suspiciousness and aggressiveness as being excessive, that would indicate neither inflexibility nor an ego syntonic quality. Such a person might have paranoid personality traits, but not the diagnosable syndrome of a personality disorder. A is incorrect because even though exposure to prejudice and discrimination might lead to a realistic sense of caution not common among people who have been free of prejudice and discrimination, but it is not likely, in and of itself, to lead to repeated agitation and aggressiveness in situations such as classrooms. People who are persistently, pervasively, inflexibly and dysfunctionally paranoid have a paranoid personality disorder regardless of the life experiences that lead to its development, and regardless of their ethnicity. B is incorrect because paranoid personality disorder can co- occur with prodromal paranoid schizophrenia if the paranoid symptoms have been pervasive and persistent throughout childhood.

B is incorrect because relaxation training is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. There is no reason to assume that your client\u2019s conduct disturbance is necessarily due to anxiety. C is incorrect because exposure and response prevention is specifically used in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. The individual is exposed to the stimulus that arouses the compulsions and is then prevented from engaging in the compulsive behavior.

You should discourage the sharing of so-called \"war stories\" which are likely to include euphoric recall and selective memory regarding positive aspects of one's substance use history. These \"war stories\" can be powerful relapse triggers. A is incorrect because the client needs to recognize the rewards experienced in relation to substance use in order to better find alternative, healthier ways of satisfying those needs. Such discussion is different than sharing \"war stories\" because it is more cognitive and reflective, rather than a matter of re-experiencing. Also, this discussion should be balanced with a discussion of the negative and delayed consequences of use, as described in answer A. B is incorrect because you should remind your client that proper sleep and nutrition are necessary to allow the neurobiology of the brain to recover from his stimulant abuse.

            "explanation": "Stimulant abuse clients do not often recognize the connections between the use of \"secondary drugs\" and their stimulant addiction. But these other drugs have commonly become triggers to stimulant abuse because of the strong association that has become established. If Pavlov's dogs could learn to salivate in response to hearing a bell, it's not hard to see how a stimulant abuser could learn to crave stimulants in response to tobacco, caffeine or marijuana use. A is incorrect because tobacco and caffeine use should be discouraged if they have become triggers, even though they are legal substances. Several \u2018studies have shown that people who give up smoking concurrently with giving up use of other drugs such as alcohol, stimulants, or marijuana have better recovery rates than people who continue smoking while working on abstinence from other drugs.

Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention, which develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. Delirium is due to either a medical condition or use of certain substances. A is incorrect because adult onset attention deficit disorder (which is not a DSM diagnosis but is a syndrome often recognized in clinical assessments) does not develop over a short period of time. B is incorrect because amphetamines, like most substances of abuse, can cause delirium during intoxication, but not during withdrawal. Alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics can cause delirium during withdrawal.

B is incorrect because these descriptive reports are much less likely to be accurate as compared to descriptions of interactions as they arise during a session. Clearly, if family members vehemently and intractably disagree with one another during a session as they tell about their excellent conflict resolution skills as a family at home, there will be more validity in what the family is observed to do rather than what they say they do. C is incorrect because clients should be allowed, or even encouraged to express hopes for the future, but this is not a focus or emphasis throughout the family therapy process. Attention to here and now interactions during sessions is just as relevant during assessment as it is during treatment plan formulation, intervention and termination.

B is incorrect because the cognitive process of reviewing the negative and delayed consequences of one's substance use may be useful during an early engagement process, or later during the maintenance phase of change, but the focus during early abstinence should be on the abstaining behaviors. C is incorrect because long term goals are too abstract and general to provide a structured focus for changing immediate behaviors.

B is a better answer because token economy can be used for the broad variety of behavior changes encompassed by \"rehabilitation\" as referenced in the question.

A score of 5 is halfway between these two extremes. B is incorrect because a score of 5 indicates half way between 0 and 10, not five times more than 0. Also, a SUDS level indicates a person\u2019s experience in relation to their own subjectively experienced extremes, not in relation to a recent baseline for this course of therapy. Note, however, that a SUDS score may be taken at baseline and then compared to a SUDS score at some other point in time. For example, a person\u2019s SUDS score at baseline might have been at 8, in other words, 80% of the highest level of anxiety ever experienced. The person\u2019s score might be at 5 a few months later. This means that the person\u2019s score became five-eighths of the score at baseline...not five times more than the score at baseline. C is also incorrect because a SUDS level indicates a person\u2019s experience in relation to their own subjectively experienced extremes, not in relation to a particular other point in time. D is incorrect because a SUDS level compares a person\u2019s level of distress to their own frame of reference, not to norms established by other people\u2019s experience.

Therefore, therapy usually focuses on resolving specific problems which may have arisen because of the symptoms, and helping with situational needs that the client is unable to meet because of the symptoms. B is incorrect because people with schizoid personality disorder tend to be detached from others. They have few relationships and, therefore, few relationship conflicts.

A systematic, orderly assessment will help a client clarify the nature of the crisis and the stressor that precipitated the crisis, as well as partialize the various aspects of the crisis.

A is incorrect because this is a therapeutic intervention technique which will follow the assessment. Anticipation of future crises is not an aspect of assessment per se. B is incorrect because focusing on restoration and enhancement of functioning is much more relevant to treatment planning and intervention than it is to assessment. Restoration and enhancement of functioning relate to how the client will change as a result of the therapy, whereas the assessment focuses on the client\u2019s status at the moment, and the events that have led up to the present moment.

Examples include kicking a soccer ball, drawing a picture which expresses her feelings, or staging a puppet show. A is incorrect because the child needs to identify and express her feelings in order to acknowledge and work through the traumatic experience. This can be a constructive process if feelings are expressed in the context of a safe, supportive relationship and in a structured way. B is incorrect because identification of automatic thoughts is a step toward reframing inappropriate and dysfunctional links between thoughts and feelings. If your client has angry and hostile feelings after being physically abused, these feelings need to be identified, expressed, accepted and validated rather than being reframed. D is incorrect because this approach will lead the child to intellectualize in a way that could foster isolation of affect and a sense of dissociation. It would be better to help her express feelings related to her own trauma and other related fearful situations so that she can work through the feelings rather than compartmentalize them."

            "explanation": "Note the word \u201cinappropriate\u201d in the question. Adolescents experience strong sexual drives and often attempt to deal with this through very moralistic and judgmental attitudes, especially in relation to the sexuality of the adults in their lives. They are sometimes criticized for being amoral because their sexual mores may be more liberal than that of some adults, or because some adolescents lose control of their impulses, but they are typically very concerned about the morality of their own and others\u2019 sexual behavior. A is incorrect because adolescents typically experience an increase in physical tension and energy. This pattern is not always evident in the morning hours (hypersomnia is more common than hyposomnia among youth) or among adolescents who are clinically depressed. C is incorrect because adolescents tend to be very focused on themselves as they struggle to resolve the question \"who am I?\" Narcissism, a possible defense against loneliness, is evident in the adolescent's sense of worry and criticism toward oneself as they strive to look and be perfect. D is incorrect because adolescents tend to make statements such as \"I will always feel this way about that\" or \"I wish I could be perfect like Pat.\" Extreme positions can often take the form of idealism and cynical disillusionment."

B is incorrect because identification of triggers and exacerbating factors is more characteristic of a cognitive or behavioral approach. C is incorrect because teaching assertion skills is also more characteristic of a behavioral approach, and is used in teaching functional communication in family therapy as well.

Despair is the result of self-fragmentation, a disowning of one\u2019s life experience through projection, displacement, rationalization and other defenses. A is incorrect because the client\u2019s sense of closeness to friends and family is more directly related to one\u2019s sense of intimacy versus isolation. C is incorrect because a client\u2019s sense of integrity or sense of despair refers to \u201ca sense of\u201d something, not one\u2019s actual ego functioning.

If this became a regular practice to the point where you felt compelled to provide the funds or had ambivalent feelings about it, this would raise problems. But in this instance the question simply says that you would like to provide the client with the funds. It would be best to register this transaction as a contribution to the \"petty cash\" fund when the clerk returns. A is incorrect because the contribution is not one of significant value, because you want to make the contribution, and because you can do so without letting the client know the source of the funds. B is incorrect because there is no indication that your client would feel dependent or guilty. B could also be a problem because your agency might not have liability insurance to cover volunteers, and because others who receive contributions from the \"petty cash\" fund may not be asked by their case managers to provide volunteer service.

Disturbed sense of reality is to be distinguished from impaired reality testing in which the person loses the ability to accurately describe external events. A is incorrect because antisocial personality traits involve exploitive and hurtful relationships with other people. It is more about behavior than it is about experience of reality. B is incorrect because people with delusional disorder have a psychotic disorder in which reality testing is impaired, but the sense of reality is not usually disturbed. In other words, the person\u2019s inaccurate beliefs about external events are experienced as real, not as strange. D is incorrect because reactive attachment disorder involves a disturbance in a young child\u2019s ability to bond, or form attachments, with others due to pathogenic caretaking. It is true that pathogenic caretaking, especially if it involves traumatic assaults, can lead to a sense of dissociation which can take the form of a disturbed sense of reality, but this feature is more characteristic of schizotypal personality traits.

A is incorrect because the law requires you to involve the parents of a minor unless it is inappropriate to do so.

By letting the disturbance show, without losing one\u2019s sense of professional role and boundaries, the therapist conveys his or her willingness to be real, or genuine, in the therapist-client relationship. A, B and C might all be good things to do with a client, but they are not as directly related to assessing a client\u2019s perception of your genuineness. A is incorrect because a therapist can deceptively communicate emotion, just as one can deceptively communicate thought. B is incorrect because acceptance can also be deceptive. If a therapist actually views a client in a judgmental way, a verbal expression of acceptance could well be at odds with a non-verbal expression of judgment. This would not convey genuineness. C is incorrect because expressions of caring concern also may or may not be genuine. D is the only answer here in which the therapist is described as expressing something that he or she is truly feeling or thinking."

A is incorrect because it would be much more effective to help the client move forward by developing stress management skills, and by engaging in health promotion activities such as exercise and social support. Somatoform symptoms, like most symptoms, are multidetermined and it may be extremely difficult if not impossible to discover the true causes of the problem. B is incorrect because this approach will encourage the client to focus on her symptoms. To the extent that she might be seeking attention or dependency, this approach might only shift some of her efforts away from the doctor and onto yourself.

If a therapist has worked with a client for over two years using several treatment strategies in order to improve self-esteem and reduce excessive guilt, and if there has been no progress, then the particular therapist is not really able to serve the client\u2019s needs. Perhaps another therapist with a different personality, style, and training in other therapy methods might be able to serve the client\u2019s needs.

It is true that family role differentiation is maintained when homeostasis is maintained, but that\u2019s only because homeostasis tends to maintain all aspects of a social system.

Entropy is not characteristic of social systems in which authority and social control are used to maintain ordered patterns of behavior. D is incorrect because assimilation and accommodation refer to how a social system relates to its environment. Assimilation occurs when a system is able to change the demands of the environment so that the environment supports the system as it is. Accommodation occurs when a system changes to meet the demands of the environment.

A is incorrect because arbitrary inference involves coming to the conclusion that you want to come to in the absence of supporting information or in spite of contradictory evidence. For example, if you believe you will never pass an exam that a great majority of people pass by the second attempt, you ignore the evidence of the high passing rate and tell yourself that the passing rate is low. C is incorrect because personalization involves erroneously assuming responsibility for external problems where little or no responsibility exists. For example \u201cMy partner beats me because I don\u2019t have his dinner on the table by the time he gets home from work.\u201d D is incorrect because catastrophic thinking involves predicting worst case scenarios while ignoring more likely outcomes.

Her husband joins the therapy for one session and demonstrates that he shares his wife\u2019s concerns. You sense that a new alliance has been created between the parents as a result of this shared concern. According to Family Systems Theory, this couple is using which strategy to handle their personal conflict? ",
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a dysfunctional strategy used by members of a family to avoid dealing with conflict in a subsystem such as the marital relationship. This strategy involves diverting the energy of the conflict to a third member of the family. There are two types of triangulation. The first, exemplified by the vignette, is termed \u201cdetour protect.\u201d This type involves two family members joining together to protect another family member. Typically, the intensity of the effort to protect appears excessive or outright unnecessary. The other type of triangulation termed \u201cdetour attack,\u201d involves two family members joining together against another family member who is seen as a common enemy. These coalitions can be formed between the mother and father or across generational boundaries. A and C are incorrect because distraction and displacement are ego defense mechanisms, aspects of personality, which may contribute to triangulation in family dynamics, but are not a matter of family dynamics per se. D is incorrect because negotiation is a healthy means of resolving conflict, not avoiding it as happens with triangulation. 172*. The correct answer is D, initiation of the differentiation process coupled with rejection of her individuation by her caretakers. Clients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder present as extremely unstable, particularly with respect to interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect. Borderline clients will often demonstrate an inability to understand that when they leave a person, that person will continue to exist. As a result, they become overwhelmed by their fear of abandonment and will tend to cling to people in moments of separation while, in contrast, they may push people away as they get too close. Kernberg and Hughes recognized the resemblance between this behavior and the behavior of a three year old child who is faced with the developmental challenge referred to by Margaret Mahler as \u201cseparation- individuation.\u201d While a child is undergoing separation-individuation, it is important that the primary caretakers support the child\u2019s efforts to separate and individuate while making it clear to the child that they are a secure base. If the caretakers do not provide a secure base for the child, separation may trigger overwhelming anxiety for the child. Like the borderline client, these children demonstrate insecurity regarding interpersonal relationships. Further research has confirmed this type of developmental impasse in the childhood histories of many borderline clients."

However, they fail to provide explanations for their rules or take into consideration the child\u2019s response to their rules. Rules are expected to be obeyed without debate. B is incorrect because, in contrast, permissive parents are low on demandingness and highly responsive. These parents tend to be very lenient and nondirective, allowing the child to create structure in his/her environment. C is incorrect because authoritative parents are highly demanding and highly responsive. These parents provide clear rules for their children but offer explanation and consider the child\u2019s perspective. Research has demonstrated that in relation to these four parenting styles, children of authoritative parents tend to become the most well adjusted adults.

C is incorrect because a client can develop a cognitive grasp of the immediate crisis by focusing on the crisis, not pervasive patterns of thought, feeling and functioning. D is incorrect because your documentation of diagnosis, symptoms, distress and impairment are not directly related to a client\u2019s sense of self-esteem. Depending on how this information is presented to a client, it may support self-esteem, threaten self-esteem, or have little or no effect on self- esteem."

            "explanation": "Humanistic Existential approaches to psychotherapy view the primary locus of change as being within the client. The quality of the therapeutic relationship releases the client\u2019s own natural healing and problem solving capacities. B is incorrect because a particular client might not have a problem with morality and ethics. In a Humanistic Existential approach each client will determine the content of therapy sessions as issues emerge for the client during sessions. C is incorrect because this approach to psychotherapy emphasizes experience rather than understanding in the intellectual sense. Also, underlying causes are not as relevant as immediate here and now experience. D is incorrect because this approach to psychotherapy focuses on immediate experience during sessions, not discussion of a client\u2019s social relationships outside of sessions."

            "explanation": "When using the brainstorming technique, the therapist initially engages the client in developing a list of alternative beliefs without considering the validity or practicality of the alternatives. The list should include whatever comes to mind. Then the client is engaged in considering potential consequences of changing the schema (or core belief) in question. B is incorrect because brainstorming initially involves a free flow of ideas that come to mind, not carefully assessed ideas. C is incorrect because brainstorming initially involves generating many alternatives, not a focus on one option. D is incorrect because in Cognitive Therapy it is primarily the client, not the therapist, who needs to generate the list of alternative beliefs."

            "explanation": "The interviewing techniques referred to in this question engage the client in a reflective discussion of the client\u2019s personality and situation. This contributes to developing a sense of control through a cognitive grasp of reality. It supports many ego functions including reality testing, judgment, sense of reality, and others. It also helps clients to perceive a range of options in resolving their problems and therefore become better able to select from among those options. A is incorrect because \u201csustaining procedures,\u201d such as demonstrations of interest, caring support, and reassurance are techniques more focused on helping a client to relax and develop a sense of support from you as the therapist. B is incorrect because \u201cventilation procedures\u201d are better geared to helping a client act out his or her inner life so that it can be observed and reflected on. Such techniques include role play, structured fantasy and play therapy. D is incorrect because \u201copportunities\u201d usually refers to resources in the social and material environment. Techniques such as distribution of public assistance, advocacy for access to community services, and referral are better geared to helping a client access opportunities for growth and more adaptive social functioning."

            "explanation": "The law states that it is a form of physical abuse to use chemical constraints or psychotropic medication for a period beyond that for which the medication was ordered pursuant to the instructions of a physician and surgeon. A is incorrect because depriving access to technology in general is not necessarily considered to be a form of abuse. Note, however, that it is illegal to prevent an elder from receiving his or her phone calls. C is incorrect because the law states that no person shall be deemed neglected or abused for the sole reason that he or she voluntarily relies on treatment by spiritual means through prayer alone in lieu of medical treatment.

A is incorrect because being held in a location against one\u2019s will is addressed in the elder adult abuse reporting act as false imprisonment or other form of isolation. C is incorrect because preventing an elder from receiving mail or phone calls constitutes isolation, not abduction. D is incorrect because threats may be a form of mental suffering, not abduction, and only if they cause fear, agitation, confusion, severe depression or other forms of serious emotional distress. It is not a matter of reportable mental suffering if the \u201cthreat\u201d to place an elder in a nursing home is being communicated because a caretaker believes that such placement is what the elder needs for proper care."

A is incorrect because an oral dependent personality is a passive, overly dependent, unenterprising personality pattern resulting from a fixation at the earlier phase of the oral stage if a child has repeated anxiety over whether food will be given or withheld. C is incorrect because \u201coral pre-operational\u201d personality is not a behavioral science concept. It is a mix of Freud\u2019s \u201coral stage\u201d concept of psychosexual development with Piaget\u2019s \u201cpre- operational\u201d stage of cognitive development.

It\u2019s not long before the listener becomes bored. A is incorrect because people with obsessive compulsive personalities tend to be counterdependent and controlling, often through passive strategies. They are not likely to evoke a sense of overprotectiveness as might be the case when working with a client who has a dependent personality. C is incorrect because guilt tends to be aroused when working with clients who are dependent, masochistic, or borderline, not obsessive compulsive.

This can lead to stimulation and growth. A is incorrect because diversity in a group tends to inhibit a sense of mutual identification initially. However, if the group can be guided through stages of healthy group development and achieve a sense of cohesion, group members can develop a mutual identification as they share their Valuing of cultural diversity itself. B is incorrect because the stimulation of different cultural perspectives is likely to be stimulating rather than relaxing and, at least initially, arouse a sense of threat as one\u2019s familiar assumptions are challenged. D is incorrect because cultural diversity can contribute to either effective or ineffective group process, depending on the group\u2019s norms and ground rules, and the support for group development provided by group leadership."

A is incorrect because recalling of pleasant memories does not cause hallucinations of any kind. C is incorrect because there is no evidence that people tend to generate recurrent hallucinations to serve a psychodynamic function. Hallucinations, especially olfactory hallucinations, are organically caused. D is incorrect because schizophrenia characteristically causes auditory hallucinations, and sometimes visual hallucinations, but it is not likely to cause olfactory hallucinations. 1.* The correct answer is B. A child\u2019s environment plays a key role in the treatment of oppositional defiant disorder. Teachers, counselors, clergy, probation officers and others in authority relationships with the child may need help learning to reinforce the techniques used by the therapist to support the child\u2019s problem solving, anger management, social skills, and communication skills by modeling and rewarding appropriate behavior in their respective community environments. A is incorrect because confrontation regarding the parents\u2019 role in the problem is more relevant to the purpose and processes of the therapeutic relationship than to the parent-teacher relationship. C is incorrect because no inherent role conflict is involved when a therapist and teacher collaborate if the two parties are clear about their respective roles and the client focused purpose of their collaboration. D is incorrect because of the importance of the teacher and others in reinforcing the techniques used by the therapist."
