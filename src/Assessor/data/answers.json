B is incorrect because personality traits are persistent qualities of personality, whereas cognitive egocentrism in a 7 year old is a normal developmental stage which will yield to perspectivism in most children as they mature. D is incorrect because perceptual dominance refers to the pre-operational period quality of allowing immediate sensory experience to override-logic if the two are in conflict. Such a quality may be related to egocentrism, but the concept of egocentrism much more closely captures the features described in the question. Keep in mind that the cognitive quality of egocentrism should not be confused with the personality trait of egocentrism.
